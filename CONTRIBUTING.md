# Contributing Guidelines

This project follows the  standards set by the Software Engineering Teaching Unit (SETU) for the SENG 31242 course.

## Branching Strategy
We use the following branch naming convention (Section 4.3):
- `main`: Protected branch. Only accepts merges via Pull Request with at least 1 approval.
- `draft/<document>`: Active working branch for a document in progress (e.g., `draft/literature-review-summary`).
- `fix/<issue-number>`: Corrective changes addressing review feedback (e.g., `fix/12`).

## Commit Message Convention
All commits must follow the **Conventional Commits** specification (Section 4.4):

### Structure
```
<type>(<scope>): <short imperative summary>

[Optional body: explain WHY this change was made, not WHAT]

[Optional footer: references to issues]
```

### Allowed Types
- `docs`: Adding or updating a document (SRS, SDS, diagrams, meeting notes).
- `feat`: Adding a new section, use case, or design element.
- `fix`: Correcting an error or incorporating review feedback.
- `refactor`: Restructuring a document without changing its content.
- `chore`: Repository housekeeping (updating .gitignore, README, etc.).
- `style`: Formatting changes only (font, heading levels, figure captions).

### Bad Examples (DO NOT USE)
- `updated srs`
- `fixed stuff`
- `changes`
- `doc`
- `v2`
- `final`
- `FINAL_FINAL`
